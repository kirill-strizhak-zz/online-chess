My old "Introduction to OOP" coursework from way back (2003-2004?). Horrible code, bad design, no tests of any kind, hand scribbled and Photoshopped images :D Hard to imagine that I got a decent mark for this (top 3 of the class) and was rather proud of it.

Would be nice to revisit it as a training material for working with legacy code. And just for the nostalgia's sake.
